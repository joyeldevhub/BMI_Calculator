# BMI_Calculator
Using Javascript Code.

## Explanation
* This code defines a JavaScript function called bmiCalculator. This function takes two parameters as input: weight and height. It is designed to calculate a person's Body Mass Index (BMI) based on their weight in kilograms and height in meters.

Inside the function:

* It calculates BMI by dividing the weight by the square of the height. The courtyard of the height is calculated using the Math.pow function, where Math.pow(height, 2) raises height to the power of 2.
* The result of this calculation is stored in the BMI variable.
* Finally, the function returns the calculated BMI value.
* Here, the BMI calculator function is called with two arguments: 65 for the weight (assumed to be in kilograms) and 1.8 for height (assumed to be in meters). The result of this function call is stored in the variable bmi.
* This line of code logs the calculated BMI value (stored in the BMI variable) to the console.
